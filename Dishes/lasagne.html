        <span>🍅 Ingredients</span> <br>
        <p>
    - 9 lasagne sheets (no-boil or pre-cooked) <br>
    - 500g minced beef <br>
    - 1 jar (about 400g) tomato pasta sauce <br>
    - 250g ricotta or cottage cheese <br>
    - 200g shredded mozzarella <br> </p>
       <p><span> 👩‍🍳 Steps </span> </p> <br>
       <p>
    - Cook the meat: Brown the minced beef in a pan over medium heat. Once cooked, stir in the tomato pasta sauce and simmer for 5–10 minutes.<br>
    - Layer up: In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce, then add lasagne sheets, followed by dollops of ricotta and a sprinkle of mozzarella. Repeat layers until ingredients are used up. <br>
    - Top it off: Finish with a final layer of lasagne sheets, meat sauce, and a generous topping of mozzarella. <br>
    - Bake: Cover with foil and bake at 180°C (350°F) for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 10–15 minutes until golden and bubbly.<br>
    - Rest & serve: Let it sit for 10 minutes before slicing. This helps it hold together better.<br>
