- Bring to room temp: Let the steak sit out for 20–30 minutes so it cooks evenly. 
- Season generously: Pat dry, then rub with olive oil, salt, and pepper on both sides. 
- Sear in a hot pan: Heat a skillet until smoking hot. Add steak and sear 2–3 minutes per side for medium-rare. 
- Add butter & garlic: Toss in butter and garlic. Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter over the steak for 1–2 minutes. 
- Rest & serve: Transfer to a plate, cover loosely with foil, and rest for 5–10 minutes before slicing. 
Garnish with rosemary or serve with sauce and fries.
