        <span>🔥 Ingredients </span><br>
- 1 thick-cut steak (ribeye, sirloin, or your favourite) <br>
- Salt & black pepper <br>
- 1 tablespoon olive oil <br>
- 1 tablespoon butter <br>
- 2 garlic cloves (crushed) <br>
<span>👨‍🍳 Steps </span><br>
- Bring to room temp: Let the steak sit out for 20–30 minutes so it cooks evenly. <br>
- Season generously: Pat dry, then rub with olive oil, salt, and pepper on both sides. <br>
- Sear in a hot pan: Heat a skillet until smoking hot. Add steak and sear 2–3 minutes per side for medium-rare. <br>
- Add butter & garlic: Toss in butter and garlic. Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter over the steak for 1–2 minutes. <br>
- Rest & serve: Transfer to a plate, cover loosely with foil, and rest for 5–10 minutes before slicing. <br>
Garnish with rosemary or serve with sauce and fries.
